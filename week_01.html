		<h2><center> - John Berger </center></h2>

		<p>I found this video to be rather interesting. Although I have always looked at different artworks and learned the history behind them, the artists, the techniques, I have never really considered how these paintings could be altered. 

		<p> In Ways of Seeing, Berger discusses how it is important to not only look at famous artworks, but also ponder our perception of the artworks and their surroundings. The video opens by declaring that perspective centers everything on the eye of the beholder. But with the invention of the camera, artworks could be viewed all over the world. Artworks were able to be viewed on a screen, and multiple perspectives emerged. Depending on what environment we are viewing the image in or what part of the image we are looking at, the feelings and thoughts that resonate from the image can be drastically different.

		<p> I never really considered how much an image could be distorted, even if the image itself had never been touched. While I was watching this video, it opened my eyes to realize that exact replicas are never truly exact; only the one original holds the artists original intent and the memories that molded it. Through the computer screen or textbook that I see it on, my life shapes the way I see it; that is how we can all have different perspectives looking at the same image. I agree with Berger that even as children, we have a way of naturally doing so.
