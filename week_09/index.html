			<p> Prior to reading these articles, I had never heard the term "Web 2.0" before. It seemed pretty self explanatory to me - a newer, better version of the internet. After reading the articles, I am a bit more confused than I was before, however I still found them interseting. I had no idea there were so many specific things that had been replaced, as I had never really thought about what the internet was like before Web 2.0 (past more sophisticated capablilities/design). In <i> What is Web 2.0 </i>, O'Reilly explores the key differences between the internet now, and Web 1.0. He thouroughly explains concepts such as the Web as Platform, Harnessing Collective Intelligence, Rich User Experiences, and more. </p>

			<p> In <i> Web Squared: Web 2.0 Five Years On </i>, O'Reilly and Battelle reflect on their original analysis of Web 2.0 and how the internet has since further evolved. I was most confused by the section where they discuss Photosynth, but I think the section Web Meets World rather makes a lot of sense. I also enjoyed reading the last section, A Call for Examples, where O'Reilly and Battelle closed off their paper with a call for input/action. </p>
