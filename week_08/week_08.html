		<h3> User Testing Feedback </h3>	

		<p> During my user testing session, I recieved a lot of good feedback on my website about the concept I was going for and how I went through with my ideas. Generally, everybody had positive feedback and didn't think I should change much. Many people gave helpful tips about the layout of my main page and helped me with some bugs I was experiencing, such as my home button not staying aligned to the right side of my pages </p>

		<center><img src = "home.png" width = 200px></center>

		<p> Something very interesting I came upon during my user testing was that <i>everybody</i> commented on my navigation bars and everybody liked the way they moved, however it was extremely two sided; half the users immediately notiecd it was spaced like piano keys, and half the users didn't realize why they were spaced like that. Ultimately, I decided to keep them that way, but I lowered the opacity slightly to make the page less busier.</p>
