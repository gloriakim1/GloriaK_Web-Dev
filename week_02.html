		<p> I have never heard of the four basic principles of the Web and while I was reading "Long Live the Web", I found it very interesting when he pointed out all the problems that are damaging these principles. Even though it didn't make sense at first, I like the way he said the Web can be "broken into fragmented islands." I completely agree with Lee that once the Web is safe place free of Cybercrime and governmetn control, we can enjoy it. However, I don't currently really see a problem with the way the Web is working currenlty. </p>

		<p> I had also never heard of the "memex" before. "As We May Think" was slightly confusing for me because of the topic and length, but I still found it intriguing in how Bush was able to come up with such a concept. The part I was most interested in was when he was explaining the evolution of the process of photography and microphotography in section 2. </p>
